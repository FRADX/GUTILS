Installation
------------

GUTILS is available through `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html>`_ and was designed with Python 3.5 or above in mind. I backported it to 2.7 by request. Please use 3.5+ if possible as the `gwt project <https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Python>`_ will soon end support for 2.7.

.. code:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge gutils
